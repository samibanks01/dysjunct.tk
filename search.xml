    <title>The Tech Uniform for every developer</title>
    <url>/2022/06/02/Blog-Technology-Programmer/The-Tech-Uniform-for-every-developer.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/magazine-1-designify_auto.jpg"></p>
<p>In the streets of San Francisco on an all-too-warm afternoon, scouting for people wearing what I thought of as the “tech uniform” - the studiedly casual California look associated with startup culture. You know the look, that company T-shirt, jeans, and the omnipresent hoodie.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>In my head, the tech uniform looked a lot like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/techuniform_auto.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-Tech-Uniform-The-Programmer-Drag"><a href="#The-Tech-Uniform-The-Programmer-Drag" class="headerlink" title="The Tech Uniform: The Programmer Drag?"></a>The Tech Uniform: The Programmer Drag?</h3><p>As noted fashion thinker and ReadWrite muse RuPaul once noted, we are born naked. The rest is drag.</p>
<p>So even as a software developer grabs whatever’s clean in his dresser, the choices he makes reflect the culture he lives and works in. Perhaps it’s not drag as much as code — an algorithm designed around efficiency. Whatever you call it, it’s a social construction, not something you’re born with or issued when your plane lands at SFO.</p>
<p>The hints are all there: the branded tees and hoodies, the two-wheeled transportation, the stubbly face in transition from a goatee to a beard. Yes, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made hoodies and Adidas flip-flops, famous or infamous. But this image isn’t based on any single person’s reality. It’s an amalgamation of many converging ideas of what startup culture looks like.</p>
<p>The idea of a tech uniform, we should note, is also stereotypically male — not so much gendered as male by default, created with the presumption of a male-dominated tech community.  It’s the intersection of many depictions of the “tech guy”, bred both within the culture and outside of it or perhaps it’s the trickle-up effect within the tech community: Young startup entrepreneurs straight out of university carry their casual academic dress into the workplace, from whiteboard sessions to board meetings.</p>
<p><img src="/images/magazine-3-designify_auto.jpg"></p>
<p>A developer who rejected “typical” programmer personality traits like nerdiness and introversion in favor of the sporty gregariousness of a college jock or fraternity pledge would not have fit in well at Facebook or anywhere. Yet as startups and technology became a sexy, mainstream phenomenon, and programming widens in its appeal, the “brogrammer” myth, picked up by the media, turns into an ideal.</p>
<p>You can have it all, kids—startup riches and bro-sanctioned masculinity!</p>
<p>Thus the uneasy marriage of the hoodie and the Under Armour compression T-shirt, the hipster bike pants and the designer jeans in today’s Silicon Valley. If watching HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” which paints brogrammers as code-typing, conniving bullies in tight T-shirts with the wrong kind of Valley accent, hurts a little, it’s because it cuts too close to the truth.</p>
<p>HBO’s “Silicon Valley” paints groups of programmers as a stereotyped flock of five” - a tall skinny white guy, short skinny Asian guy, fat guy with a ponytail, some guy with crazy facial hair, and then an East Indian guy. It’s like they trade guys until they all have the right group.” This stereotype defied discovery — I couldn’t find a group like this if I tried. But I did catch a trio emerging from GitHub’s San Francisco headquarters.</p>
<p>GitHub’s David Newman describes that attitude as “intentionally casual.” He explained that often in a tech company, newer employees will want to wear clothes marked with the company logo in order to represent the brand. After the initial phase of decking themselves out in head-to-toe company merch, employees then go through a period of distancing from the brand.</p>
<p>The science of a tech company shirt is really complex.</p>
<p>Wearing newer shirts could signify a newbie — a new hire. Non-company shirts may be worn by a longtime staffer comfortable in his role. Or these longstanding employees might also wear older company T-shirts, with outdated logos, to indicate all the years they’ve put in. At this point in the conversation I felt as though I was being taught the etiquette of a 17th-century French court.</p>
<p>This idea that specific T-shirt customs within a tech company can follow certain rules and imply meaning, power, and hierarchy is a fascinating one.<br>It’s an example of how the everyday fashion choices of bosses and coworkers influences others in the company. Employees may not judge one another for their brand of plaid for the day, but a 2008-era GitHub shirt? That alone speaks volumes.</p>
<p>So maybe TV does get it right sometimes. I saw bits and pieces of my stereotypical tech-guy avatar at various points in my photo journey; a fixie bike here, some Warby Parker glasses there, and company T-shirts everywhere.</p>
<p>Like so many other styles of clothing, the tech uniform is a mishmash of street style and mainstream influences. Through it all, there’s a fundamental idea: Dressing not for success, but for happiness. It’s a dream we can all aspire to—if only putting on the uniform was all we had to do to live the fantasy of today’s Silicon Valley.</p>
